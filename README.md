# goesNOW

This chrome extension will click through the GOES website
and compares the old date you have reserved with the
next available date and will pop up an alert if the new date
is better than your existing one. This is hard coded to only
check available dates at SFO

## How to use
1. Download the files and place them in a folder.
1. In Chrome, go to extensions and select `load unpacked extension...`
1. Go to the GOES page and log in
1. Wait until you get an alert
1. Schedule your appointment!

## Notes
There is a known issue with users getting some sort of system error
and having to log in again. I can't test this since I no longer
have an account that needs to schedule an appointment.
